## Key Features

- ‚¨áÔ∏è **Download** - Access EarthCARE data via the command line or your Python scripts.
- üîç **Search & Read** - Search your local EarthCARE products and open them as `xarray.Dataset` objects with unified dimension names.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Process** - Make use of a comprehensive set of functions, including filtering by time or geographic location, extracting vertical profile statistics, rebinning, along-track interpolation from X-MET files, and merging consecutive EarthCARE datasets, and more.
- üìä **Visualize** - Create quicklooks and plot vertical and across-track time series using a set of `matplotlib`/`cartopy`-based figure objects - while allowing customization.
- üíª **Command-Line Interface Tools:**
    - [`ecdownload`](./ecdownload.md) - Search, select, and download EarthCARE data from a terminal.
    - [`ecquicklook`](./ecquicklook.md) - Create fast preview visualisations of EarthCARE datasets from a terminal.
